# NitroBoost
This is a simple resource which allows you to do something based upon a discord role. Such as if they are boosting a server they can have the ability to spawn a vehicle etc.
To change the role needed go to sv_nitro.lua -> exports['discordroles']:isRolePresent(source, {'yourRoleHere'} and change yourRoleHere to whatever role you want.
To change what you want to happen if they have a role then go tot cl_nitro -> Line 29 to 62 and delete that and change the event to what you want to happen.
